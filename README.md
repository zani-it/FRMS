# FRMS (Fast Registry Management System)


### FRMS is a web application that simplifies patient intake forms for healthcare facilities. 
It automatically detects existing patients in waiting rooms or identification kiosks and adds them to a waitlist. Healthcare professionals can then access and edit the patient's intake form. 
Patients do not use the app directly, but they can check their waitlist status and medical information when they are in a private consultation with a healthcare professional. Additionally, healthcare professionals can search for their last saved form by entering their patient's email address. These added functionalities make it easier for healthcare professionals to provide quality care and for patients to manage their health information.

This application is designed to run on a local closed network.

#### Detect a Face and Compare with Existing Database

Takes the image of a patient and compares it with similar landmarks for faces in the local MySQL database. If a face is found, the server updates the WebSocket-connected clients with the patient information to load the waitlist and doctor patient forms. If no face is found, it triggers the second API below:

```http
  POST /detect
```

| Body | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `image(base_64)` | `string` | `Image data of patient` |

#### ADD a Face to be used in the following request

Adds a patient to the database so that the patient information can be found and returned from the recognized face.

```http
  POST "https://www.betafaceapi.com/api/v2/media"
```
| Body | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `image(base_64)` | `string` | `Image data of patient`   |
`recognize_targets` | `string`  | `all@frms.scae`|
`detection_min_score` | `number` | `Minimum detection score`|

#### Register a new user

Adds a patient to the database so that the patient information can be found and returned from the recognized face.

```http
  POST "https://www.betafaceapi.com/api/v2/media"
```

  | Body | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `image(base_64)` | `string` | `Image data of patient`   |
|`recognize_targets` | `string`  | `all@frms.scae`|
|`set_person_id` | `string` | `ID of person to be created` |
|`detection_min_score` | `number` | `Minimum detection score`|

##### Modify a patient information in the database

Modify a client in the mySQL database and update the clients with the new information form the mySQL database.

```http
  post /modify
```

| Body | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `firstName` | `string` | `Patient Name` | 
| `lastName` | `string` | `Patient Last Name` |
| `email` | `string` |  | `Patient Email` |
| `sexAtBirth` | `string` | `Patient Sex At Birth` |
| `dateOfBirth` | `string` | `Patient Date Of Birth` |
| `age` | `string` | `Patient Age` |
| `medicalCondition` | `string` | `Patient Medical Condition` |
| `medicalSpecialty` | `string` | `Patient Medical Special` |
| `details` | `string` | `Patient Details` |

#### Find a patient in the mySQL database

Return the patient information from the face recognized and autofill the form.

```http
  post /find
```

| Body | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |

### About the challenge

Completing a project that involves using multiple technologies such as React.js, machine learning, Sass, MySQL, REST API, Express server, and libraries in just 11 days can be quite challenging for a single developer. However, with the right motivation and dedication, it is possible to accomplish great things even as a solo developer. The project's successful completion is a testament to the developer's ability to learn new technologies quickly and efficiently, as well as their determination to produce high-quality work.
